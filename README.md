## My Submission to the RailsWorld ticket giveaway by the Ruby on Rails podcast

Thanks for taking the time to look at my submission! This whole thing was a good bit of fun and I thoroughly enjoyed learning some Shoes.
I am completely aware that this code is horribly designed and repetitive but I only heard about the giveaway a couple days before the deadline, so it was ugly code or no code - I'll be sure to clean it up at some point (hopefully).

I am also aware the program occasionally crashes (yikes), if that happens please just run it again and it should work as normal.

You should be able to run this with your usual method of running scarpe. The only thing that may cause issues is the file path for the images, although I have tried to set these up so that they should work straight away.

Thanks again for taking a look at my submission!
